I am currently a PhD student at the University of Washington, advised by [Su In Lee](https://suinlee.cs.washington.edu/). I am interested in developing methods to make machine learning models more interpretable, and applying such methods to understand biological and health data. 

Outside of work I spend time playing piano, and occasionally attending [my father's](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/) talks.
